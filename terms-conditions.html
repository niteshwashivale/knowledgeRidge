                        <p>
                            <b>Introduction:</b> KR offers industry executives and professionals the opportunity to register

                            ("Clients," may include professional services firms, investment management firms, and corporations).
                            These consulting services may include phone interviews, in-person meetings, workshops, field
                            visits, group/panel discussions, surveys, or other consulting engagements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Participation:</b> You may participate with KR’s clients’ consulting engagements only if you
                            are not restricted from doing so by contractual, fiduciary or any other obligations. By joining
                            KR’s global network of experts, you represent that you are not restricted from doing so. Your
                            participation in these consulting engagements will be in your personal capacity and not on behalf
                            of any other entity, unless there is a written agreement between such entity and KR.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>As a KR Expert:</b> You are free to accept or decline any offer to provide consulting services
                            in your sole discretion, provided, however, that you may accept only those consulting engagements
                            that

                            <b>Payments:</b> Once a consulting engagement is confirmed with you, please provide your payment
                            preference and details to your point of contact at KR. Unless you have received prior authorization
                            from KR, you will not be compensated for any time in preparation of, or in follow-up to consulting
                            engagement. Clients cannot authorize such additional work. KR will compensate you only for consulting
                            engagements that are arranged and/or pre-approved by KR.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Payments are combined on monthly basis and processed automatically by 15th of the following month. For example: For all KR
                            consulting engagements that you participate in during the month of January, payment will be combined
                            and processed by 15th of February. You agree to deliver information that we may reasonably require
                            to comply with tax reporting and withholding obligations (if applicable).

                            professionalism and courtesy in their interactions with KR and its Clients. Experts must not
                            disclose any information that is confidential, proprietary, material non-public, or covered by
                            any nondisclosure agreement to which you are a party.
